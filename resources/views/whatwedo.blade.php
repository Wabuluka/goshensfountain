						<h4>The Mobile Nutrition Clinic</h4>
						<p>Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health is operating a Mobile Nutrition Clinic to address Nutrition issues among the children, pregnant and lactating mothers and PLWHIV/AIDS undergoing Anti-Retroviral Treatment. We are currently running the Nutrition clinic in Goma Health Center 3 in Mukono – Uganda and the surrounding villages. We shall be rolling out the clinic services to the rest of the country.</p>
						<ul>
							<h5>The clinic activities include;</h5>
							<li>Screening children for malnutrition by taking their MUAC, Height, length (Babies) and weight where the acutely malnourished are referred to government Nutrition centers (Mwanamugimu) and other better equipped facilities. Other cases are managed by giving supplements to the affected. We undertake a feeding program for the malnourished children on a specially developed supplement by the Goshen’s team by giving rations to the care givers with clear preparation guidelines. The care givers are trained on making local recipes of nutritious mixtures using the staple foods available.</li>
							<li>We have a follow up program on the currently managed cases of malnourished children to assess progress on the client.</li>
							<li>As Goshen’s, we conduct awareness sessions for the care givers on the preparation of nutritious meals for the vulnerable groups.</li>
							<li>We give pre and post testing counseling services to the care givers of the children in relation to HIV. We encouraged mothers who bring children for nutrition assessments to voluntarily have the HIV status of their children and their own ascertained by running serology tests. The counseling services are offered by a team of qualified Goshen’s counselors. We also encourage the mothers to come along with their husbands for HIV pretest counseling for eventual voluntary testing. We encourage couples to come for counseling and testing.</li>
							<li>As Goshen’s, we encourage households to have HIV status of their entire households established.</li>
							<li>In conjunction with the ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment) clinic at the health centers, the clients undertaking ARV therapy are advised on the appropriate meal composition to take care of the side effects of the drugs and also boost the immunity system to fight the opportunistic infections. Nutrition is a crucial component in the ARV administration that cannot be under estimated and the clients are enlightened on the linkages between HIV and nutrition.</li>
							<li>As Goshen’s, we offer follow up counseling services to the HIV positive clients to hear their views and find out how they are coping with the drugs. For clients that are not following their drug administration schedules, the counseling team establishes the reason for failure to adherence.</li>
							<li>We undertake follow up on clients who are on Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) to ensure compliance on drug taking and also as reminders to keep appointment of clinic visits to pick drugs. This is undertaken through bulk SMSs we periodically send to the clients. The clients are also given nutritional counseling.</li>
							<li>As Goshen’s we carry on awareness programs in communities, public and private institutions on the dangers of HIV/AIDS and passing on the slogan "SAYING NO TO HIV STARTS WITH ME". </li>
							<li>As Goshen’s, we promote safe male circumcision program for the children, the youth and the adults as a strategy to reduces the infection rates for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases like Gonorrhea, and syphilis. We design and pass on messages in local languages about the spread and dangers of HIV & other STDs.</li>
							<li>Other than services on HIV and Nutrition, Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health also carries on screening clients for others medical sicknesses like High blood pressure and skin problems. Other conditions likes Diabetes, dental, optical issues will be addressed once Goshen’s gets the capacity in terms of facilities and equipment to manage.</li>
							<li>As Goshen’s we move clinical services near the needing population for those who cannot afford transport to the health centers.</li>

					<div class="">
						<h4>Community Cook Days</h4>
						<p>Goshen's Fountain of Nutrition and Health organises Cook Days in communities to sensitize the locals on basic healthy eating habits</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health’s mission statement is "Promoting Nutrition and Health through Community" and this is promoted by organizing the households into functional groups where each group under their own leadership will develop nutritious food mixes and their after prepare sample meals for the various vulnerable groups. </li>
							<li>This also helps to test their knowledge of the different food groups and the composition of each group like Proteins, carbohydrates, Vitamins. In their groups, using the food type identification cards, they are allowed to arrange the food cards in groups. For example arranging the different foods in categories like (Carbohydrates comprises of; Maize four, Rice etc& Proteins comprises of; Beans, beef etc). This exercise helps households to easily remember each food group, examples and the nutritional benefits of each food type.</li>
							<li>This exercise acts as a baseline to understand their knowledge about different food types and the food crops under each type. After the exercise, the Goshen’s Nutrition team gives remarks on each group performance and advises of the winning group which is recognized for good performance.</li>

				<section id="KitchenGardening">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Kitchen Gardening</h4>
						<p>As Goshen’s we encourage households to grow green leafy vegetables in kitchen gardens for sustainable balanced diet. Kitchen gardens are easy to manage since they are within the household vicinity and do not required much space. Harvests from kitchen gardens can as well be sold by the households to earn an income.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s we support households start sack/kitchen gardens and give them vegetable seedlings, empty sacks and training as startup kits.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section id="PostHarvestHandling">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Post-Harvest Handling</h4>
						<p>Post- harvest handling is key in determining the quality of household meals and hence nutrition. The way crops are handled after harvesting determines safety of food in terms of contamination. Post-harvest handling is a critical entry point for germs. </p>
						<p>Traditionally in our Ugandan culture, communities have a belief that once harvested; crops have to be dried on bare ground in order to boost the taste of the meals. This is a risky practice because such crops are exposed to contamination and hence affecting quality of food. On consumption, since these crops are already contaminated, they lead to diarrhea which does not allow the bodies absorb the nutrients hence causing malnutrition in the vulnerable groups.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health, we have interventions of sensitizing household farmers on the benefits of good post-harvest handling that range from food safety to good market prices for their produce. </p>
						<p>Farmers are trained on how to make raised platforms of stones and timber on which bags of produce are placed to avoid spoilage. Farmers also trained on how to use local affordable preservation methods like application of ash. Farmers are encouraged to dry their produce on tarpaulins though most of them face a challenge of affordability.</p>

				<section id="SchoolHealthProgram">
					<div class="">
						<h4>School Health Program</h4>
						<p>Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health has a program of promoting nutrition and health in schools. This is program is aimed at Integrating Food and Nutrition, Health, Agricultural and Environmental Education in schools for sustainable development.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health we conduct awareness in schools on the benefits of adopting a school health program.</p>
						<p>Among others, we also support schools start out small vegetable gardens and encourage them to feed students on green leafy vegetables for balance dieting.</p>

				<section id="WaterSanitationHygiene">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene</h4>
						<p>Diarrhea caused by poor sanitation, lack of hygiene and unsafe water is one of the leading causes of child health death globally, and the leading cause of death in sub- Sahara Africa. Worse yet, diarrheal diseases inhabit nutrient absorption leading to starvation even if sufficient nutrition is consumed. Under nutrition also reduces a child’s resistance to subsequent infections. Even if diarrhea does not kill outright, repeated bouts during early childhood negatively impact physical and cognitive development.</p>
						<p>There is emerging evidence that the intestinal disease known as environmental enteropathy also has an effect on child growth. Environmental enteropathy affects the small intestines and is the result of chronic child exposure to fecal microbes due to poor sanitation. It also reduces the child’s ability to absorb nutrients.</p>
						<p>Safe drinking water, proper sanitation and hygiene can prevent under nutrition and stunting in children by preventing development of environmental enteropathy and diarrheal diseases.</p>
						<p>Children living in households with proper sanitation and hygiene are taller for their age, or less stunted, compared to children living in contaminated environments.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health, we promote hand washing with soap as an element of hygiene programming and this can reduce the incidence of diarrhea. Hand washing, water quality treatment, sanitation and hygiene are core interventions for maternal and child under nutrition and survival.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health, we carry out activities aimed at encouraging households to each have a latrine to avoid open defecation. Toilets have a significant effect on children’s health and nutrition. Access to toilets can help children reach their full physical and mental potential. Likewise, the absence of toilets can have profound implications on the children. Imagine in an environment without latrines means people practice open defecation in the same fields where children play whereby they put their fingers in their mouths without knowing the contaminants on their fingers.</p>
						<p>To promote this objective, we do community sensitization where households are reminded of the dangers of open defecation and are encouraged to construct latrines. We also sensitize communities on the importance of hand washing after visiting the latrines and the likely dangers in terms of disease exposure. We distribute 5 liter empty jerry cans to households where they keep water for washing hands after a latrine visit.</p>
						<p>We also do household visits as a form of onsite inspection together with the local leaders to engage families without latrines to ensure they construct them.</p>
						<p>In a bid to promote safe water, we encourage communities to have protected well springs to avoid contamination.</p>

				<section id="SupportOfOVC">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Support of the Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) and other vulnerable groups</h4>
						<p>Goshen’s Fountains of Nutrition and Health offers support of the OVCs and other vulnerable groups like pregnant and lactating mothers, the elderly and PLWHIV. We offer support to OVCs that are infected and affected by the HIV epidemic.</p>
						<p>We have enrolled 300 OVCs for support under our programs. They need support for scholastic requirements, nutrition support, and skills empowerment for the grownups.</p>
						<p>To the affected groups, we do pre testing counseling; we do HIV screening and post testing counseling for both those found to be positive and negative. The positive are linked to care.</p>
						<p>For OVCs who have already known their status to be HIV positive, we link them to care and we emphasize to them the importance of compliance with the ARV taking. We offer them posttest counseling also highlighting nutrition.</p>
						<p>For OVCs who are found negative, we sensitize on prevention and they undergo counseling sessions on the dangers of HIV, how it is transmitted and how to keep themselves free from being infected.</p>
						<p>We also support in their education needs like scholastic materials for those ready to continue with education. We also lobby for bursaries from other stake holders.</p>
						<p>We offer vocational training to OVCs that are ready for skills. Some of the programs offered are; craft making, metal fabrication, liquid soap making, tailoring, charcoal lighter making, Jewelry making.</p>

				<section id="EconomicEmpowerment">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Economic Empowerment for the Youth, OVCs and Low Income Women</h4>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health, we run a program aimed at empowering the vulnerable groups with hands-on skill that will enable them make a living. The incomes enable the households take care of their nutrition and other household needs. We train them in craft making; we offer financial literacy training, tailoring and knitting, baking.</p>
						<p>Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health believes in economic empowerment for sustainability rather than giving food and cash handouts.  Once empowered, households are able to take care of their total needs and can also support others.</p>
						<p>Household Economic Strengthening is the ideal solution to eradicating poverty, malnutrition and disease which are the biggest global challenges leading to death.</p>

				<section id="EnvironmentalConservation">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Environmental Conservation</h4>
						<p>Environment conservation impacts directly on the nutrition of a community where by in communities where the environment has been conserved there will be sufficient rain fall hence conducive for crops to grow and households will have sufficient food. In times of bumpy harvest, some food is sold for income to carter for other household needs.</p>
						<p>As Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health we encourage household communities to plant fruit trees and other trees to conserve the environment.</p>
						<p>At least every household should plant fruit trees like mangoes, jack fruit and avocado trees.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section id="RecipeDevelopment">
					<div class="">
						<h4>Recipe Development</h4>
						<p>Goshen’s Fountain of Nutrition and Health supports rural house hold communities in developing local nutritious recipes to carter for their nutrition needs. The recipes are developed using the local staple food crops.</p>
						<p>Households are encouraged to develop their own recipes.</p>
						<p>A recipe guide/manual detailing preparation protocols for the various meals will be developed once the households come up with their own new recipes and this will be translated in the local language to enable households follow procedure.</p>
